## Task:
Learn and use genetic algorithm to automate the the classic Flappy Bird game, and produce a webapp.

## Algorithm

- Starts out with a pool of models whose number is specified by the user based on their system performace.
- For ach iteration based on fitness scores of the models, perform crossover.
- Crossover would swap the first layers (input -> hidden) for both the selected parents with good score.
- Random mutation ensures that the models are changed at every iteration to improve the odds of getting a better mutation.

## Result
Successful implementation of the mentioned task
